# FediPod

- access the fediverse from a Solid pod

`FediPod` is a standalone, single-user ActivityPub and ATProto agent that stores your public data on almost any subdomained Solid Pod and runs on any device that supports node >20. The agent can be moved from one device to another without any change to your account. There is support for fediverse group formation and management, see [Groups](groups.md).

This project is inspired by the fantastic [ActivityPods project](https://github.com/activitypods) and is meant to be a lightweight alternative rather than a replacement.

## Requirements

* a web browser
* node 20 or greater
* a local or remote Solid pod that
  * supports subdomains and https
  * has a domain name
  * is almost always on

Note : if you don't have a pod account, setup will easily create one for you.

## Installation

In a terminal :

```
git clone https://github.com/jeff-zucker/FediPod;
cd FediPod;
npm install
```

## Setup

You only have to do setup once per device. Just run `npm start` from the project folder. From nothing — no fediverse account, no pod — one command creates the account, the pod, the actor, and leaves you in the client looking at your fediverse home with a pre-stocked home feed. Setup will prompt you for needed information. If you already have a pod, you'll be offered the opportunity to either create a new pod for your FediPod data or to store it on your existing pod.

### Running the agent

From the install folder, run `npm start`. You may optionally add a port number (`npm start 8081`) to change your local agent's port (default is 8030).

Now point your browser (any) at http://localhost:8030 — or your own port if you set one — and there you go!

### Running the agent as a service

If you don't want to run the agent each time, you can install it as a system service. This is recommended as leaving the agent off causes your mail to pile up on the pod host.  To create a system service :
```
npm run install-service
```
It registers every identity on this machine, one service each, so all of your actors start at boot. An identity running in a terminal is stopped and taken over by its service.

`npm run uninstall-service` reverses it. 

## Managing your FediPod install

You can manage your posts, see logs, park, move, transfer your account and perform other actions. See the [GUI admin](gui.md) and [CLI admin](cli.md) pages.

You can also use the admin tools to create other actors, either groups or persons.  You may have as many as you want on the local machine, but each one needs a separate pod.

## Fediverse Clients

The UI is the bundled [Phanpy](https://github.com/cheeaun/phanpy)
client (MIT, by Chee Aun); patched to allow the loopback http origin. It is served same-origin over the agent's Mastodon client-API facade. Log in with one
click, using `localhost:8030` (or your own port) as the instance.

The agent federates for real: follow/unfollow, post, reply, favourite,
boost, media, delete; incoming boosts from people you follow and a
configurable public-hashtag feed (`POST /tagfeed`) fill the timeline.
Also: editing posts, content warnings, polls and voting, all four visibility
levels (followers-only and direct posts work only on a pod that enforces
access control — on one that doesn't, the composer refuses and says why),
a conversations view for direct messages, bookmarks, favourites, lists,
keyword filters, scheduled posts, pinned posts (visible from other servers),
blocking and muting from the client, custom emojis, and web-push
notifications that reach you while the client is closed.

### Ailo AI providers and link safety

People can enter, test, replace, and remove their own provider keys from the
**FediPod → AI provider keys** panel in Ailo. FediPod stores those keys in
`provider-secrets.json` inside the active identity directory with owner-only
permissions (`0600`). Stored values are never returned to Ailo, copied to the
Solid Pod, or published to the Fediverse; clients receive only configured/source
state and model names.

For headless installations, environment variables remain supported as a
fallback. A key saved through Ailo overrides its environment counterpart; when
that saved key is removed, FediPod falls back to the environment value:

```sh
AP_OPENAI_API_KEY=...              # or OPENAI_API_KEY
AP_GEMINI_API_KEY=...              # or GEMINI_API_KEY
AP_AI_PROVIDER=gemini              # optional default: gemini or openai
AP_GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3.6-flash   # optional
AP_GEMINI_EMBEDDING_MODEL=gemini-embedding-2
```

Google Safe Browsing link checks use a separate credential:

```sh
AP_GOOGLE_SAFE_BROWSING_API_KEY=... # or GOOGLE_SAFE_BROWSING_API_KEY
```

Safe Browsing URL Search sends the complete URL being checked to Google and is
available for non-commercial use only; commercial applications should use
Google Web Risk. Google cannot guarantee comprehensive or error-free results:
some risky sites may not be identified and some safe sites may be identified
in error. Responses are cached only for Google's stated duration, with unsafe
classifications refreshed within 30 minutes.


### Other clients

- **Web clients**: drop any static Mastodon client dist into `ui/<name>/`
  and it is served at `/<name>/`, same-origin — see `ui/README.md`.
- **Desktop clients** (Tuba, Whalebird, …): add `http://localhost:8030` (or other port for other agent) as a
  custom instance.
- **Streaming**: the agent serves the Mastodon streaming API
  (`/api/v1/streaming`, WebSocket) so clients update live instead of polling.

## Bluesky and ATProto

`FediPod` includes experimental support for ATProto. A Bluesky connection lets your `FediPod` agent drive an existing Bluesky (or other ATProto) account alongside your fediverse identity. When you post a public post from `FediPod`, it will be cross-posted to Bluesky as a mirror (a toggle you can turn off). Private DMs from `FediPod` to Bluesky are not currently supported.  Bluesky replies and activity flow into your timeline so you see, for example, a combined Bluesky and Mastodon feed.  You can like, boost, and reply to Bluesky posts from within `FediPod`.  None of these features require `Bridgy Fed`, however, fully joining a `FediPod` group from a Bluesky client other than `FediPod` does require a bridge.


## Architecture

`Activitypods` requires a server which provides both an ActivityPub server and a Solid server and thus requires a specific server setup.  `FediPod`, on the other hand, can be installed on any subdomained https-served pod.  It does this by splitting the ActivityPub server into two parts.  The pod part provides discovery (webfinger) and stores mostly public data while the local server provides the ActivityPub actions and storage for most private data. The exception is private direct messages which are stored on the pod protected by ACL resources.

// run-agent.mjs — fedipod: a standalone single-actor ActivityPub
// agent. The remote pod is a RELAY: it serves the public wire face
// (/activitypods-js/ap/) and buffers inbound mail in a public-append inbox
// while this process is off, and it keeps one private document, the lease,
// because a lock only one machine can reach coordinates nothing.
//
// Everything else private is on THIS machine — the RDF truth and the
// operational state, in a directory beside the credential and the signing key.
// So a machine holding only the credential file does NOT resume the actor: it
// resumes the identity with an empty timeline, contacts, blocklist and
// notifications, and `fedipod rebuild` recovers the posts the pod still
// carries. `privateRoot` absent in credential.json is the pre-2026-08-03
// layout and still means both trees are on the pod; `fedipod upgrade`
// says so and `state --all` moves them.
//
//   node run-agent.mjs                      # or: bin/fedipod.mjs run
//
// Env: AP_HOME (credential dir + local log, default ~/.fedipod, or
//      ~/.activitypod on an install that predates the rename — see lib/home.mjs),
//      AP_PORT (UI/API/admin, default 8030),
//      AP_GATE_TOKEN (optional loopback gate; absent → open, loopback-only).
//
// Until `bin/fedipod.mjs setup` has minted a credential the agent idles:
// UI + admin up, no federation.

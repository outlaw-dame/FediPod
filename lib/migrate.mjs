// Keeping every identity on this machine at the current shape of an install.
//
// bbba587 fixed the DEFAULT: a new install keeps its private half — timeline,
// contacts, blocklist, notifications, masto-tokens.json — on this machine.
// It did nothing for the installs that already existed, and `privateRoot`
// absent still means "on the pod" (run-agent.mjs privateUrls). So an identity
// set up before that commit still writes every state change to a pod, and
// still keeps its private data on a server.
//
// A new default only ever fixes the installs that do not exist yet. That is the
// reason this file exists rather than a one-off script: a change to install
// shape ships as a numbered step HERE, and `fedipod upgrade` runs the
// pending ones over every identity under the root, not just the one you
// happened to be in.

// Bump when a step is added, and add the step to pendingSteps below.
